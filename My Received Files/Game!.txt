plot; you are on some small plan going somewhere who cares. crashes on an island. fuck, theres some little lizard 
things, they are fucking dinosaurs holy shit!! [like the one in the second jurassic park]. then you backhand a few,
 but more come, and you have to bail. you go through the plane crash, find some radio, and decide you need to climb
 to the highest peak of the island for reception and shit like that. as you travel, you cross more and more dinos,
 some plant, some meat eaters.



gameplay; its not meant to be some stupid shoot'em'up like everything is nowadays. you make your own way through 
the island. you start off with nothing. you come accross a meat eating dinosaur, and you better fucking run. it 
will be hard to escape them, you character runs slower and faster over differrent surfaces, very realistic, through 
the island, forest, beach, mountains, etc. you need to build shelters to protect you in storms and places to sleep,
 preferably up high so you dont get attacked overnight. you need to find your own food. if you dont eat well, you'll
 get sick, make you slower and weaker. the more stuff you find you can make better shelters, and as you get better
 you can even set traps for some of the dinosaurs to eat, or just kill them before they kill you. you can 
attributes so you are fast so you can run away from all sorts of things, but sometimes you'll have to push them 
off you and stuff so you'll need to be strong for that. im thinking very realistic weather changes and landscape.
eventually i think you'll get off the island. i havent thought as much about the end as i have about the middle. 
its so fun running away from things you have no chance of beating. theres not enough of that in games nowadays now 
its just get strong and own everything.

if you die youd lose heaps of stuff like shelters, food storages, traps you'd set, XP for attributes.
